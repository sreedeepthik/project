		<p>A coffee bean is a seed of the coffee plant and the source for coffee. It is the pit inside the red or purple fruit often referred to as a cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also a so-called stone fruit. Even though the coffee beans are seeds, they are referred to as "beans" because of their resemblance to true beans. The fruits coffee cherries or coffee berries – most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together. A small percentage of cherries contain a single seed, instead of the usual two. This is called a "peaberry". The peaberry occurs only between 10 and 15% of the time, and it is a fairly common (yet scientifically unproven) belief that they have more flavour than normal coffee beans. The two most economically important varieties of coffee plant are the Arabica and the Robusta.</p>

<p>	According to popular legend, the coffee plant was discovered in Ethiopia by a goatherd named Kaldi.</p>

    <p>First cultivation in India (Chikmagalur) – 1600</p>
    <p>First cultivation in Europe (also first cultivation outside of east Africa/Arabia) – 1616</p>
    <p>First cultivation in Java – 1699</p>
